An object is immutable when its state doesn’t change after it has been initialized. For example, String is an immutable class and,
 once instantiated, the value of a String object never changes. Learn more about why the String class is immutable in Java.
Because an immutable object can’t be updated, programs need to create a new object for every change of state. However, immutable
objects also have the following benefits:

An immutable class is good for caching purposes because you don’t have to worry about the value changes.
An immutable class is inherently thread-safe, so you don’t have to worry about thread safety in multi-threaded environments.


To create an immutable class in Java, you need to follow these general principles:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Declare the class as final so it can’t be extended.
Make all of the fields private so that direct access is not allowed.
Don’t provide setter methods for variables.
Make all mutable fields final so that a field’s value can be assigned only once.
Initialize all fields using a constructor method performing deep copy.
Perform cloning of objects in the getter methods to return a copy rather than returning the actual object reference.
